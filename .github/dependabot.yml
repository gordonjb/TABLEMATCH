# To get started with Dependabot version updates, you'll need to specify which
# package ecosystems to update and where the package manifests are located.
# Please see the documentation for all configuration options:
# https://docs.github.com/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/configuration-options-for-the-dependabot.yml-file

updates:
  # Enable version updates for npm
  - package-ecosystem: "npm"
    # Look for `package.json` and `lock` files in the `root` directory
    directory: "/"
    # Check the npm registry for updates weekly
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
  
  # Enable version updates for uv
  # disabling as it apparently doesn't work yet but leaving for later
  #- package-ecosystem: "uv"
  #  # Look for a `Dockerfile` in the `/py` directory

  - package-ecosystem: "github-actions"
    # Workflow files stored in the default location of `.github/workflows`
